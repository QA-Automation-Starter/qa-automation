# QA Testing Parent

Provides default configuration for QA Automation projects.
Also provides Maven profiles for managing logs, devices, providers
and test suites. There is a special profile for generating a standalone test
executable to used in constrained environments.

If your project already has a parent,
see [QA Testing Starter](../qa-testing-starter/README.md).
