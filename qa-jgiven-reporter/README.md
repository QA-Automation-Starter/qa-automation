# QA JGiven Reporter

Generates textual reports from JGiven's JSON files. The reports can be
generated per-class, per-method, or for entire suite.

The format of the reports is controlled by built-in JMustache-templates. These
defaults can be overriden, thus full customization is supported -- see:
* [QA TestRail Reporter](../qa-testrail-reporter/README.md) 
* [QA JGiven Reporter Maven Plugin](../qa-jgiven-reporter-maven-plugin/README.md)
  as examples of how to implement custom reporters.
